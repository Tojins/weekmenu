# Shopping List Filter Bug Investigation Report

## Summary
After thorough investigation and testing, the filtering functionality appears to be **working correctly** in the codebase.

## Investigation Details

### Code Analysis
1. **ListSelectorModal** (src/components/ListSelectorModal.jsx):
   - Lines 17-21: Correctly creates a Set of store IDs that have active lists
   - Line 21: `hasAvailableStores` properly checks if any stores don't have lists
   - Lines 86-92: Passes the lists to NewListModal for filtering

2. **NewListModal** (src/components/NewListModal.jsx):
   - Lines 12-16: Correctly filters stores to exclude those with active lists
   - Line 16: `availableStores` only contains stores without active lists

3. **Data Fetching**:
   - Uses React Query with proper query keys
   - `useShoppingLists()` hook properly fetches lists with subscription ID
   - `useStores()` hook fetches all available stores

### Test Results
1. When no lists exist: All stores are shown as available ✅
2. When all stores have lists: "All stores already have active shopping lists" message is shown ✅
3. Filtering is consistent between home page and add-to-list page ✅

## Potential Issues

### 1. Cache Invalidation
After creating a new list, the React Query cache might not be invalidated properly, causing stale data to be shown.

### 2. Data Scope
The test environment might have different data than production, making it hard to reproduce the exact scenario.

### 3. User Misunderstanding
The user mentioned "hundreds of lists" in the future. The current implementation filters based on active lists only, which is correct behavior.

## Recommendations

1. **Verify Cache Invalidation**: Check that after creating a new list, the shopping lists query is properly invalidated
2. **Add Data Refresh**: Consider adding a manual refresh after list creation
3. **Test with Production-like Data**: Create tests with many stores and lists to simulate the "hundreds of lists" scenario

## Test Files Created
- `tests/e2e/bugs/change-list-filter-bug.spec.js`
- `tests/e2e/bugs/change-list-filter-bug-simple.spec.js`
- `tests/e2e/bugs/change-list-filter-direct.spec.js`
- `tests/e2e/bugs/change-list-filter-with-data.spec.js`
- `tests/e2e/bugs/verify-filter-behavior.spec.js`
- `tests/fixtures/shopping-list.fixture.js`

## Conclusion
The filtering logic is implemented correctly. The issue might be related to data fetching, caching, or test environment differences rather than the filtering logic itself.
